# HooverAI
This project is for demonstration only.  Thank you.

This project emulates an automated vacuum based on an x,y coordinate system.  The program takes a file input.txt in the following format:<br>
5 5<br>
1 2<br>
1 0<br>
2 2<br>
2 3<br>
NNESEESWNWW<br>

The first x,y pair 5 5 is the size of the grid the vacuum can hoover over.
The second x,y pair is the starting location of the vacuum.
The third  through N pairs of x,y coordinates are known patches which need to be cleaned.
The last line is driving instructions with N for go north, S for go south, E for go East and W for go West.

The program can be ran by downloading the files and compiling them in any IDE or with javac.  HooverAI was written using Java 1.8.
